DO I NEED TO INSTALL ANYTHING?

    no.

HOW TO USE:

    To use this program, all you need to do is type stuff into the terminal when prompted, as everything here is text based. For example, if the program were to ask you: Add more ingredients (y/n)? you would ismply type 'y' or 'n' and then press the enter button. 

THINGS TO BE AWARE OF:

    In most cases you have to type in EXACTLY what the program asks you to type in or else the program might result in an error (ex. inputting a letter instead of a number after being asked for a number.)

    BE CAREFUL OF HARD MODE, IF YOU FAIL IT WILL RESTART YOUR COMPUTER (if you are on windows, im not sure if the method I used to restart the system works on other operating systems.)
